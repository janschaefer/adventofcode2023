# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions for [Advent Of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). My plan is to solve every puzzle with a different programming language, in alphabetical order. I make use of ChatGPT to help me with the programming language, however, I will not use it directly to help me solve the problem. In addition, I make use of the Replit AI code completion with the same intention.


| Puzzle | Programming Language | Status | Replit | ChatGPT | Experience |
| -------| ---------------------|--------|--------|---------|------------|
| [1](1) | [C](https://www.iso.org/standard/74528.html) | ⭐⭐ | [Replit](https://replit.com/@janschaefer0/AdventOfCode202301) | [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/c485697a-da04-4e53-aa73-4d4d9220a598) | String manipulations with C are awful. It took me ages to just get a substring from a string and I most likely introduced a memory leak ;-) |
| [2](2) | [C++](https://isocpp.org/) | ⭐⭐ | [Replit](https://replit.com/@janschaefer0/AdventOfCode202302) | - | Much better than C due to standard library functions |
| [3](3) | [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) | ⭐⭐ | [Replit](https://replit.com/@janschaefer0/AdventOfCode202303) | [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/3769f2d7-a019-43e6-9454-100d7ac5e75d)| I feel nearly at home, because it is like Java ;-). My solution could have been more elegant, but I solved this one much faster than the other two. |
| [4](4) | [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)  | ⭐⭐ | [Replit](https://replit.com/@janschaefer0/AdventOfCode202304) | [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/22e255fd-13e4-44db-956a-b97fedf4d9d8) | Took me ages to deal with a cryptic EOF error and syntax is hard to read for my eyes, but otherwise it was quite fun to think in a functional style. This puzzle took me longer than any other one so-far, but the solution is the most elegant one ;-) |
| [5](5) | [Dart](https://dart.dev/) | ⭐⭐ | [Replit](https://replit.com/@janschaefer0/AdventOfCode202305) | [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/fc28f96a-251b-4875-b53d-53703e52c835) | Dart feels a lot like Java, not sure why Dart exists at all, but maybe I had not really hit the interesting features of the language with the puzzle, like the concurrency model. I had no real issues with the language. My Replit ran out of AI credits ;-) |
| 6 | [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) | | | | |
| 7 | Elm | | | | |
| 8 | Erlang | | | | |
| 9 | F# | | | | |
| 10 | Go | | | | |
| 11 | Haskell | | | | |
| 12 | Java | | | | |
| 13 | JavaScript | | | | |
| 14 | Kotlin | | | | |
| 15 | Lua | | | | |
| 16 | OCaml | | | | |
| 17 | Perl | | | | |
| 18 | PHP | | | | |
| 19 | Python | | | | |
| 20 | R | | | | |
| 21 | Ruby | | | | | 
| 22 | Rust | | | | |
| 23 | Scala | | | | |
| 24 | Swift | | | | | 
| 25 | TypeScript | | | | |
